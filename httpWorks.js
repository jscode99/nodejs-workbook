/**
 * ========================== How the web works ===============================
 * -) Computers connected to the internet are called clients and servers.
 * 
 * -) Clients are internet-connected devices such as computer and mobile phones along
 *    with web-accessing software available on those devices such as web browsers.
 * 
 * -) Server on the other hand are computers that store web pages, sites or apps.
 * 
 * -) Client-Server Model : When you type a URL in the web browser, client device requests
 *                          access to a web page, a copy of the web page is downloaded from the server
 *                          and send as a response to the client to be displayed in the web browser.
 * 
 * ================================= HTTP ========================================
 * -) Hypertext Transfer Protocol
 * 
 * -) A protocol that defines a format for clients and servers to speak to each other.
 * 
 * -) The client sends an HTTP request and the server responds with an HTTP response.
 * 
 * 
 * ================================= HTTP and Node =================================
 * -) We can create a web server using Node.js.
 * 
 * -) Node.js has access to operating system functionality like networking.
 * 
 * -) Node.js has an event loop to run tasks asynchronously and is perfect for creating web servers
 *    that can simultaneously handle large volumes of requests.
 * 
 * -) The node server we create should still respect the HTTP format.
 * 
 * -) The HTTP module allows creation of web servers that can transfer data over HTTP.
